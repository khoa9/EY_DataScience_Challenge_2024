# Tropical Cyclone Damage Assessment Using Satellite Imagery

<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview

This is the project that got my team into top participants and got a certification in the EY Open Science Data Challenge 2024. 

This project focuses on the assessment of damage caused by tropical cyclones using high-resolution satellite images. The aim is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and categorizing damage to coastal infrastructure, including residential and commercial buildings. By automating the detection of damaged and undamaged buildings, this project contributes to efficient and rapid disaster response efforts.

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection.

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
## Methodology

The workflow of this project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Utilize high-resolution pre- and post-event satellite imagery from sources like Maxar GeoEye-1, as well as moderate-resolution images from European Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites.
2. **Data Annotation**: Employ LabelMe, an open-source graphical image annotation tool, to manually annotate images for training the model. Annotations identify various structures as 'Undamaged Residential Building', 'Damaged Residential Building', 'Undamaged Commercial Building', and 'Damaged Commercial Building'.
3. **Model Training**: Use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for identifying and classifying the annotated buildings in satellite images. The model is trained on the annotated dataset to detect and distinguish between damaged and undamaged infrastructure.
4. **Evaluation and Improvement**: Assess the model's performance and iteratively refine the approach to improve accuracy and reliability in detecting and classifying building damage.

<!-- OBJECTIVES -->
## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

- **Rapid Damage Assessment**: Enable faster assessment of infrastructure damage following tropical cyclones to aid in timely disaster response and recovery efforts.
- **Automated Analysis**: Reduce the reliance on manual analysis of satellite imagery, thereby increasing the speed and scale at which damage assessments can be conducted.
- **Accuracy and Precision**: Develop a model that not only identifies damaged structures but also categorizes them with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for disaster response teams.
